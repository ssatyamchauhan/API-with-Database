<h1 align="center">Simple Api With Database</h1>

Implemented a simple Api with database using *ExpressJs* and Sqlite3. Performed CRUD operation with SQliteDB and expressJs.

# ExpressJs

*Express* is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js. You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the NodeJs that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

# Sqlite3

*Sqlite3* is a relational database management system. This is the place where you store information for your websites.

# CRUD

 *CRUD* is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE respectively). This is what each operation does:
 
 - Create (POST) - Make something
 - Read (GET)_- Get something
 - Update (PUT) - Change something
 - Delete (Delete) - Remove something

### If we put CRUD, Express and SQlite3DB together into a single diagram, this is what it would look like:
